The goal of this project is to develop a command line utility that leverages SQL to perform various operations on a hierarchical data structure. The utility will primarily focus on manipulating nodes within the structure and achieving the following objectives:

- [X] **1.** Find all children of a given node,
- [X] **2.** Count all children of a given node,
- [X] **3.** Find all grand children of a given node,
- [X] **4.** Find all parents of a given node,
- [X] **5.** Count all parents of a given node,
- [X] **6.** Find all grand parents of a given node,
- [X] **7.** Counts how many uniquely named nodes there are,
- [X] **8.** Find a root node, one which is not a subcategory of any other node,
- [X] **9.** Find nodes with the most children, there could be more the one,
- [X] **10.** Find nodes with the least children, there could be more the one,
- [X] **11.** Rename a given node.
